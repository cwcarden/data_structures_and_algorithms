"""
Create a random list of 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 integers with each number
between 1 and 10 million.  Measure how long it takes to sort each list using the
built-in list's sort method. In comments, list the specifications of your computer
(CPU chip and clock speed, operating system, and Python version) along with how 
long it took to sort each list.  Also include comments that indicate what you 
think the Î˜ classification is for the sort method based on the running times.
