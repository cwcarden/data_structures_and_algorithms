# Chapter 1 Abstraction and Analysis

## Notes

### Alan Turing 
He conjectured that any problem solvable with a computer only needs the
basic statements that all computer languages have: 

> Decision statements (if)

> Looping (for and while)

> The ability to store and retrieve data.

### Functional Abstraction
> Decomposes it into a set of functions. Also called procedural abstraction.
